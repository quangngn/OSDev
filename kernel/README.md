# Starter Kernel
This is the starter kernel code for the spring 2022 offering of CSC 395: Advanced Operating Systems at Grinnell College. This project includes the basic elements required to build and run a simple kernel on an x86_64 machine emulated with QEMU.

## Acknowledgements
This starter code is based on the following example projects:
- [OSDev.org Bare Bones Kernel](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_bones)
- [Stivale2 Barebones Kernel](https://github.com/stivale/stivale2-barebones)

In addition to the above example projects, the following references were used when setting up this code:
